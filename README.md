# CPSC-131-Project-02
For this group project, we have created and maintained a collection of books to form a book list (which is the BookList class).
Books are placed on the list, removed from the list, and reordered within the list. Our goal was to complete the implementation and
to reinforce four data structure concepts (arrays, extendable vectors, singly-linked lists, and doubly-linked lists).
Also, our book list implementation mirrors book insertion, removal, and reordering requests to each of four STL containers in C++.
